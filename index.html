        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="bodyText">
            Compared to most other IT students, my experience has been very different. I graduated from high school in the spring of 2018 and started at PPU in the fall, 1 class shy of being a sophomore. I finished my first semester as a Legal Studies major before switching to IT. Because of this, I have had to take multiple courses without having the prereqrequites met, such as taking my Senior Capstone at the same time as Advanced Programming so I can graduate in the fall.         </p>

            I have had an interest in computers for as long as I can remember. I have always enjoyed repairing various devices, rooting/jailbreaking phones, and data mining the files for various games to give myself in-game currency. Besides messing around with these various subjects, I also play a lot of FPS and RPGs in my spare time. I had a lot of spare time in high school, which is strange since I took 10 college courses between my Junior and Senior year, in addition to 4 years of Mock Trial, but I still always found time to play games with my friends. I look forward to working with Virtual Machines in my Server Management class and expanding my HTML/CSS experience, which was non-existant prior to this assignment, with Advanced Programming.
