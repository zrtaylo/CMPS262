<p>While I have met a lot of great people at PPU, but I have learned that the school has a lot of flaws</p>
<p>Over the Summer I plan on completing an IT internship at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio</p>
<p>After graduating in the Fall I will be taking a much needed vacation to Canada with a few of my cousins to see the Northern Lights (first time out of the country)</p>
